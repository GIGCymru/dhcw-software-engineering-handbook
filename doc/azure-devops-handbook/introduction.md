## The need for guidance

We use Azure DevOps to manage thousands of tasks, performed daily by
hundreds of staff. Following good practice is essential to ensure
consistent use across the organisation.

This standard is designed to help you plan, build and release software
in a way that enables seamless coordination across teams and boundaries.
