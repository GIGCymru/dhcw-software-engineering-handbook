# Introduction

## Purpose

To help you test for lost updates and other database concurrency bugs.
You will learn -

- How collaboration improves testing and why developers should also
    write test scripts.

- How to follow our Test Framework and apply a risk-based approach.

- Common patterns, architects and developers use to solve concurrency
    conflicts.

- The types of tests you will need and examples of authentic test
    scripts.

## Scope

### In-scope

- This guide helps you to test software and follow our Test Framework.

### Out-of-scope

- Post-deployment surveillance tests are not included in scope.

## Roles & responsibilities

We write this for Test Analysts. But everyone has a part to play :-

- Business analysts determine the need for concurrency in the
    requirements.

- Architects and developers build concurrency control into the
    designs.

- Developers and testers verify these designs beyond the user
    interface.

- Support run surveillance scripts to continue testing after
    deployment.

- Everyone takes part in sprint ceremonies. Because these interactions
    refine your approach, ensuring it's fit for purpose.

Only by doing this, will you have confidence to test for lost updates
and concurrency bugs.
